        “ My story started in advertising in 2017. After exploring different things, I found
        that my passion and interests are different from the scope of design and advertising.
        In 2019, I took a huge step forward to become a Web Developer. As a fast learner,
        effective communicator, a designer who turned into a developer, I carry a good
        attention to details, and ability to take feedback positively, I keep evolving to
        become a better developer day by day. ”
